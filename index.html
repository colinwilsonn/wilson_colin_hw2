                <h3>Kenny McCormick</h3>
                <p>Kenny McCormick is known for his iconic orange parka and frequent, absurd deaths, which have become a running joke on South Park. Despite his rough upbringing, Kenny is a loyal friend and often the most daring of the group. He also adopts the persona of Mysterion, a masked vigilante who fights crime and seeks justice in South Park. As Mysterion, Kenny's character takes on a more serious tone, showcasing a hidden depth behind his usual comedic role.</p>

                <h3>Randy Marsh</h3>
                <p>Randy Marsh is Stan's eccentric and unpredictable father, known for his wild antics and bizarre behavior. Whether starting a marijuana business or engaging in outlandish schemes, Randy often creates chaos rather than solving problems. His impulsiveness and absurd decisions provide much of the show's adult humor, making him both a source of comedy and social commentary. Despite his flaws, Randy is deeply caring for his family, though his actions often lead to unintended consequences.</p>
